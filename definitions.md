# Terms and definitions

## adverse actions
>actions performed by a threat agent on an asset

## assets
>entities that the owner of the TOE presumably places value upon

## assurance
>grounds for confidence that a TOE meets the SFRs

## attack potential
>measure of the effort to be expended in attacking a TOE, expressed in terms of an attacker's expertise,

## augmentation
>addition of one or more requirement(s) to a package

## authentication data
>information used to verify the claimed identity of a user

## authorised user
>TOE user who may, in accordance with the SFRs, perform an operation

## coherent
>logically ordered and having discernible meaning

!!!alert
For documentation, this addresses both the actual text and the structure of the document, in terms of whether
it is understandable by its target audience.

## component
>smallest selectable set of elements on which requirements may be based

## confirm
>declare that something has been reviewed in detail with an independent determination of sufficiency

## connectivity
>property of the TOE allowing interaction with IT entities external to the TOE

!!!alert
This includes exchange of data by wire or by wireless means, over any distance in any environment or
configuration.

## consistent
>relationship between two or more entities such that there are no apparent contradictions between these entities

## counter
>defend an attack where the impact of a particular threat is mitigated but not necessarily eradicated

## ensure
> guarantee a strong causal relationship between an action and its consequences

## exhaustive
>characteristic of a methodical approach taken to perform an analysis or activity according to an unambiguous plan

!!!alert
This term is used in ISO/IEC 15408 with respect to conducting an analysis or other activity. It is related to
“systematic” but is considerably stronger, in that it indicates not only that a methodical approach has been taken to
perform the analysis or activity according to an unambiguous plan, but that the plan that was followed is sufficient to
ensure that all possible avenues have been exercised.

## external entity
>human or IT entity possibly interacting with the TOE from outside of the TOE boundary

!!!alert
An external entity can also be referred to as a user. 

## guidance documentation
>documentation that describes the delivery, preparation, operation, management and/or use of the TOE

## identity
>representation uniquely identifying entities (e.g. a user, a process or a disk) within the context of the TOE

!!!alert
An example of such a representation is a string. For a human user, the representation can be the full or
abbreviated name or a (still unique) pseudonym.

## internally consistent
no apparent contradictions exist between any aspects of an entity

!!!alert
In terms of documentation, this means that there can be no statements within the documentation that can be taken to contradict each other.

## organizational security policy
>set of security rules, procedures, or guidelines for an organization

!!!alert
A policy may pertain to a specific operational environment.

## Protection Profile
>implementation-independent statement of security needs for a TOE type

## prove
> show correspondence by formal analysis in its mathematical sense

## role
>predefined set of rules establishing the allowed interactions between a user and the TOE

## secret
>information that must be known only to authorised users and/or the TSF in order to enforce a specific SFP

## secure state
> state in which the TSF data are consistent and the TSF continues correct enforcement of the SFRs

## security attribute
>property of subjects, users (including external IT products), objects, information, sessions and/or resources that is used in defining the SFRs and whose values are used in enforcing the SFRs

## security function policy
> set of rules describing specific security behaviour enforced by the TSF and expressible as a set of SFRs

## security objective
> statement of an intent to counter identified threats and/or satisfy identified organization security policies and/or assumptions

## security requirement
> requirement, stated in a standardised language, which is meant to contribute to achieving the security

## Security Target
>implementation-dependent statement of security needs for a specific identified TOE

## target of evaluation
>set of software, firmware and/or hardware possibly accompanied by guidance documents

## threat agent
>entity that can adversely act on assets

## TOE evaluation
> assessment of a TOE against defined criteria

## TOE resource
> anything useable or consumable in the TOE

## TOE security functionality
> combined functionality of all hardware, software, and firmware of a TOE that must be relied upon for thecorrect enforcement of the SFRs

## trusted channel
> a means by which a TSF and another trusted IT product can communicate with necessary confidence

## trusted IT product
> IT product, other than the TOE, which has its security functional requirements administratively coordinated with the TOE and which is assumed to enforce its security functional requirements correctly

!!!alert
An example of a trusted IT product would be one that has been separately evaluated.

## trusted path
>means by which a user and a TSF can communicate with the necessary confidence

## TSF data
> data for the operation of the TOE upon which the enforcement of the SFR relies

## user data
>data for the user, that does not affect the operation of the TSF
